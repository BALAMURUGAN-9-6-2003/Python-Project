Abstract: PDF to Audio Converter GUI

This Python program offers a user-friendly interface for converting PDF files into audio format. The graphical interface allows users to choose a PDF file, select a voice (male or female), and then either play the audio or save it as an MP3 file.

The program utilizes the `PyPDF2` library to extract text from each page of the PDF and `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech conversion. Users can customize the voice settings, including the choice between male and female voices.

Key Features:
- Choose a PDF file using a file dialog.
- Select a voice preference (male or female).
- Play the audio directly or save it as an MP3 file.
- Option to specify the desired file name for the saved audio.

The GUI is designed with simplicity in mind, featuring buttons for file selection, voice options, and actions like playing or saving the audio. Error handling is incorporated to provide informative messages in case of any issues.

This program serves as a convenient tool for users who prefer audio content or have accessibility needs, offering a straightforward way to convert PDF documents into spoken words.
